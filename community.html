            <p class="desc">Description:Most of the Countries collect information/ maintain inventory on the Chemical and Petrochemical 
                sector for monitoring and policy making to improve this sector. There is standard practice for data collection for those
                 countries who are the member of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) and other countries. D/o Chemicals and Petrochemicals, M/o Chemicals and Fertilizers are desirous to make a Web Based Application/ Portal to develop an Integrated Data Management system (IDMS) for the Chemical and Petrochemicals Sector. The main goal is to design an integrated data management that would gather, store and share information about various facets of the chemical and petrochemical industry including market standards as well as allow for mapping all relevant data to automate different fields of chemicals and petrochemical sector for the Govt. of India. With the designed system, the specific data variable needs like advanced product search and comparison, technical 
                data sheets generation, and creating a solid data management platform for true collaboration of different countries

        <p class="desc">Description :The water footprint measures the amount of water used to produce each of the goods and services we use.
             The water footprint helps us understand for what purposes our limited freshwater resources are being consumed and polluted.
              The impact of it depends on where the water is taken from and when if it comes from a place where water is already scarce, the consequences can be significant and require action. The increase in the amount of non- available water due to pollution and scarce groundwater level has added more water footprints, at the community as well as at the personal levels. An increased water footprint directly affects the health and future of the citizens. Preventing severe drought in water-stressed areas is only going to be possible if water is used with more care and efficiency, this can be done if we have readily available data on water footprints. Hence by using digital technologies like AI, Big Data, Blockchain, etc, and computer languages, a user-friendly app or website may be developed which can provide the water footprints of different items/ final products we use in daily life by feeding little inputs or just by scanning through the camera like Google lens. The app should support local languages, 
            this will ensure pan-India usage and sensitize the people about the water footprints of items they use in daily life.

        <h6 class="t1Head">Automatic regulation of valves for release of water based upon soil moisture availability in the root zone of the crop, 
            using artificial intelligence, in a piped and micro irrigation network of irrigation system.</h6>
            <p class="desc">Description:In modern agricultural practices, efficient water management plays a critical role in achieving optimal crop yields, 
                conserving water resources, and maintaining ecological balance. However, existing irrigation systems often lack the precision required to deliver water 
                tailored to the actual needs of crops, leading to water wastage, suboptimal plant growth, and environmental degradation. This problem is particularly pronounced in 
                piped and micro irrigation networks, where traditional methods of manual control fail to adapt dynamically to varying soil moisture conditions within the root zone of crops. 
                The core issue lies in the absence of an automated mechanism that can regulate the release of water based on real-time soil moisture availability. The inconsistency in water distribution and the inability to synchronize irrigation with crop water requirements result in detrimental outcomes for both the agricultural yield and water conservation efforts. To address this problem, there is a compelling need for an innovative solution that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to enable the automatic regulation of valves for water release in piped and micro irrigation networks. By incorporating AI-powered soil moisture monitoring and decision-making processes, this solution aims to bridge the gap between water supply and crop demand, while also optimizing resource utilization and minimizing environmental impact. Key Challenges: Dynamic Water Demand: Crops have varying water requirements influenced by factors such as growth stage, weather conditions, and plant type. Developing an AI system capable of accurately predicting these dynamic water demands is a complex challenge. Real-time Data Integration: Integrating real-time soil moisture data from multiple sensors across a field into a centralized AI system requires robust data collection, transmission, and processing mechanisms. Algorithm Precision: Designing AI algorithms that can effectively analyze soil moisture data, historical trends, and other relevant parameters to make accurate decisions about water release timing and quantities. Valve Control Mechanism: Developing an automated valve control mechanism that can respond swiftly and accurately to the AI's recommendations while considering the physical characteristics of the piped and micro irrigation network. Adaptability: Ensuring that the AI system can adapt to changing environmental
                 conditions, crop types, and variations in soil properties over time. User-Friendly Interface: Designing a user-friendly interface that allows farmers and irrigation managers to monitor and intervene in the system as needed, while also trusting in the AI's autonomous decisions. Economic Viability: Balancing the potential costs of implementing an AI-driven system with the expected benefits in terms of increased 
                 crop yield, water savings, and operational efficiency.<br/>
